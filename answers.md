 Fundamentals of Software Testing - Assignment 1

 1. What is Static Testing, and Why Is It Important in Software Development?

Definition:  
Static testing is a software testing technique that evaluates code, design, and documentation without executing the program.

Importance:
- Detects defects early in the development process.
- Reduces development costs by identifying issues before execution.
- Improves code quality through reviews and analysis.
- Ensures compliance with coding standards.

 Example:
Conducting a code review to identify syntax errors and security vulnerabilities before compiling the code.

 2. Differentiate Between Walkthroughs, Technical Reviews, and Inspections

| Review Type | Definition | Role in Static Testing |
|------------|------------|------------------------|
| Walkthroughs | Informal review where the author explains the code or document to peers. | Helps in early defect detection and knowledge sharing. |
| Technical Reviews | A structured peer review process focused on improving software design and implementation. | Ensures software meets design requirements and coding standards. |
| Inspections | A formal review led by a moderator, involving defect logging and documentation. | Identifies critical issues and ensures high-quality deliverables. |

 How They Help in Static Testing:
- Improve software quality by identifying defects early.
- Facilitate knowledge sharing among team members.
- Enhance software maintainability through structured feedback.

 3. What Are Static Analysis Tools, and How Do They Improve Software Quality?

 Definition:
Static analysis tools automatically examine source code without executing it to detect potential issues such as security vulnerabilities, code complexity, and syntax errors.

 How They Improve Software Quality:
- Identify bugs and vulnerabilities early in development.
- Ensure compliance with coding best practices and security standards.
- Reduce the need for extensive debugging and rework.
- Improve code maintainability by enforcing consistency.
